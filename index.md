## Welcome to Gianluca Valerio Home Page

My name is Gianluca Valerio.
I grew up in Italy in  town called Livorno. My father was a lighthouse keeper, and in my young life i live in incredible places, in front of the sea and sometimes far from local small town. I love everything related to sea (windsurf, sailing, swimming …)! I have study Economics at the University of Pisa but after i finish i realize that my technical/computer science skill where predominant.  After spending 1 year in searching a job tailed to my Economics degree I join a consulting technology company of the IBM Global Service named CGI and then in 2000 I join another big company.
I now live in Giulianova, in Abruzzo - Italy - with my wife and my two sons John 8y, and Jack 5y.
I love watching movies and personal hobby are music and painting.
I have a degree of 5 years at conservatory for piano – when I was young I was dreaming to be a musicians but I’m not so good, while painting I believe is the best native capabilities that I have.
A little story: Milan 1998 - during the interview of my first job, when the interviewer was making the questions, I was drawing on a small piece of paper, sometimes I use to draw to keep pressure out. At the end of the interview (not so good, not so bad), the interviewer ask me to see what I have drawn during the interview, and he was so surprised that he choose to hire me immediately (the same day he brings me to Human Resource Director), so let me say that this capability had also influenced my career.  

## My current skills
